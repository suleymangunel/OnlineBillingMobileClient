Casio IT9000 Based Online Billing Software (Terminal Side)

Changing the billing system from offline to online. For this purpose, I
purchased Casio IT9000 terminals and prepared the necessary client/server
softwares. I added many advanced features to my client(IT9000) software;
Battery usage optimization, GPS & Google Earth integration for tracking
terminals on Google Maps, image transfer from terminalâ€™s camera to image
server, etc. I also prepared the necessary web services for integration
with banks and simultaneous bill transfer
